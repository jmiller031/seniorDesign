# GWU 2021-2022 Capstone Project: Galleri

The easiest way to run our app would be to download it on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/galleri/id1585596000). However, if you would prefer to run it on your own machine, see below.


Dependencies:
[Node.js + npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm),
[React Native](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native),
[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

After these packages are installed, follow along [here](https://blog.logrocket.com/xcode-for-react-native-developers-tutorial-and-best-practices/) in order to simulate the iOS app on your computer.

If AWS is causing trouble, see the IAM credentials in the final report.
