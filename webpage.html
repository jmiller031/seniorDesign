<h1>GWU Capstone 2022: Galleri</h1>
<p><strong>Project Description</strong> <br />Galleri, the Fine Art app, is designed to bridge the gap between classic works of fine art and the younger soon-to-be art enthusiasts. Art consumption is decreasing among adolescents, who are missing out on the numerous mental health benefits of exposure to the arts. Our app provides a simple yet interactive platform that allows users to swipe through a virtual art gallery, indicating their preferences with each swipe. Similar to popular dating apps, a right swipe indicates positive sentiment, and a left swipe indicates negative sentiment. As the user continues to swipe, the recommender system within our app learns the user&rsquo;s preferences, and is able to recommend the user artwork that more closely matches their tastes. The user interface is kept very simple, with the user&rsquo;s actions being restricted to swiping and tapping. By tapping an image, the user is able to see more information about the app, such as artist, title, etc. Our gallery contains images scraped from the Artsy Genome Project, which hosts an enormous art database with robust metadata for each piece, making it an ideal candidate for recommender systems. Galleri also displays these images by retrieving them from Artsy&rsquo;s database, meaning that the app takes up extremely little storage space on a phone.</p>
